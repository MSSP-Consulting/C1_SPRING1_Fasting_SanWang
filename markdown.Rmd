```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#read in the data
library(readxl)
data_fasting <- read_excel("MIT Fasting Study PN#358.xlsx")
```

```{r}
#visualizing data
boxplot(GLU12HFast ~ GenderAgeCat, data=data_fasting, frame = FALSE,
        col = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"), ylab="GLU12HFast")
```

```{r}
#two-way anova test
#see if GLU12HFast levels are affected by age and gender
glu12hfast <- aov(GLU12HFast ~ AgeCat + Gender, data = data_fasting)
summary(glu12hfast)
```
Based on the p-values, it seems like neither AgeCat nor Gender are very telling 
of glucose levels after 12-hour fast. 

```{r}
#36 hour fast results
glu36hfast <- aov(GLU36HFast ~ AgeCat + Gender, data = data_fasting)
summary(glu36hfast)
```
Based on the p-values, it seems like neither AgeCat nor Gender are very telling 
of glucose levels after 36-hour fast.
